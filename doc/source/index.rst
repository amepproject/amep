AMEP |release| documentation
============================

The **AMEP** (**A**\ ctive **M**\ atter **E**\ valuation **P**\ ackage) Python library 
is a powerful tool for analyzing data from molecular-dynamics (MD), 
Brownian-dynamics (BD), and continuum simulations. It comprises various 
methods to analyze structural and dynamical properties of condensed matter 
systems in general and active matter systems in particular. **AMEP** is 
exclusively built on Python, and therefore, it is easy to modify and allows to 
easily add user-defined functions. **AMEP** provides an efficient data format 
for saving both simulation data and analysis results based on the HDF5 file 
format. To be fast and usable on modern HPC (**H**\ igh **P**\ erformance 
**C**\ omputing) hardware, the methods are optimized to run also in parallel.
