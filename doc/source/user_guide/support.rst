Support
=======
If you need support for using AMEP, please feel free to contact us either 
directly on our `GitHub discussions <https://github.com/amepproject/amep/discussions>`_ 
page. If you find a bug or inconsistency, please create an `issue <https://github.com/amepproject/amep/issues>`_.

Creating issues
---------------

To create an issue, go to `<https://github.com/amepproject/amep/issues>`_ and
click on ``New issue``. Then, continue with the following steps:

1. Add a short and clear title.
2. Write a precise description of the bug which you found.
3. Add a minimal working example (MWE) to reproduce the bug.
4. If you got an error message, add it to the description.
5. If it is already known how the bug can be fixed, please add a short to-do list to the description.

When creating issues, text is written as markdown, which allows formatting text, code, or 
tables for example. A useful guide can be found `here <https://www.markdownguide.org/>`_.
